360 virtual walk through.

In the era of Covid awareness, I created this tool for realestate to show their listings with a virtual 360 walkthrough.
I snapped the 360 images, draw the floor plans and ran it through three.js. The first version was created with A-frame, but cut out to make this more lightweight.
